LeadingCharacters LC = they substitute the namespace name. 
example 	for AssLogic namespace the LC = AL
	for AssUI namespace the LC = AUI

-class and struct declaration
we are going to use the LC followed by one or more Capitalized words without seperation
example : ALMasterControl




-variables
written in lowercase, if more than one words use underscore "_" as seperator,
Non-static member variables are named with the prefix "m"
Static member variables are named with the prefix "ms"
Examples : m_counter, ms_counter



-member function names
Capitalized words with no seperator
example : Function GetCounter()
		return 0
	End Function


-function arguments
prefix "a", underscore seperated words
example : Function GetCounter(ByVal a_number As Integer)

        		Return a_number
	End Function


-tab spacing
each scope has a tab space of 4 spaces
example :
public class ALMasterControl
    dim m_counter As Integer
end class



-code commenting
code commenting is expected
	class level - give a description of the class before the class declaration
	variable level - give a description of the variables before their declaration
	function level - give a description of the function before the function declaration
	in-function level - give description of the algorithm inside the function for each line
it is adviced to use just as much commenting as needed(not too much or too little)
